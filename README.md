[📄 中文文档](README.zh.md)

A C++23 Minecraft Bedrock network protocol library.

[Protocol 2193 migration notes and validation (Chinese)](PROTOCOL_2193.md)

Protocol provides Bedrock packet models, packet ID mapping, and binary
read/write utilities for building high-performance servers, proxies,
analyzers, and protocol test suites.

## 🔌 CMake Integration

After installation, consume the library with CMake:

```cmake
find_package(Protocol CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Protocol::Protocol)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```cpp
#include <sculk/protocol/MinecraftPackets.hpp>
#include <sculk/protocol/packet/IPacket.hpp>
#include <sculk/protocol/utility/BinaryStream.hpp>
#include <sculk/protocol/utility/ReadOnlyBinaryStream.hpp>

#include <cstddef>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    using namespace sculk::protocol;

    // Example input from network transport.
    std::vector<std::byte> input{};

    ReadOnlyBinaryStream readStream{input};
    const auto header = MinecraftPackets::readPacketHeader(readStream);
    auto packet = MinecraftPackets::createPacket(header);

    if (packet) {
        const auto readResult = packet->read(readStream);
        if (!readResult) {
            return 1;
        }

        std::vector<std::byte> output;
        BinaryStream writeStream{output};
        packet->writeWithHeader(writeStream);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
